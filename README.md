## promisedws
PromisedWS is an extremely barebones, promise based socket communication library originally made for communication between a web panel and a Discord bot. That being said, it's currently only allows `server -> client -> server` communication (message and response).

## Future
-   [ ] Message and response typings
-   [ ] Client identification
